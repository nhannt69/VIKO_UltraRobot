## Project Overview
The Welding Auto Inspection project aims to inspect the surface of welds using a Micro Epsilon 30x2-50 laser system combined with a Basler camera for automated weld identification. The project has successfully integrated multiple modules, resulting in a fully automated inspection process.

## Key Achievements
- **High Accuracy in Weld Identification:**
  - The Vision module has achieved an accuracy rate of 95.36% in identifying welds, ensuring reliable detection and analysis.
  
- **Efficient Laser Scanning Performance:**
  - Laser scanning operates at a speed of 65 mm/s with a detailed resolution of 100 µm x 49 µm, providing precise measurements for surface inspection.

- **Advanced Software Control:**
  - The new control system allows individual robot control, enabling real-time adjustments and more accurate tracking of robot behavior.

- **Rapid 3D Visualization:**
  - The system supports 3D visualization with processing times under 1 second, typically around 0.5 seconds, ensuring swift data interpretation.

- **Comprehensive Automation:**
  - All modules (Vision, Laser, Software, Robot, and Inspection) have been fully integrated, enabling a seamless and automated inspection process for flat objects.
